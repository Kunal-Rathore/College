// for loop fibonacci
// check 09.cpp about order of printing and recursion calling         -> REASON IS CAUSE IF RECURSION CALL IS STARTING FROM INDEX += 1 MEANS FROM 1TH INDEX
// store digit of n = 4215 in vector
// having vector in input and give no. in output (opposite of above)
// babar  <= string and target = a print index of target
// babar  <= string and target = a store index of target in vector
